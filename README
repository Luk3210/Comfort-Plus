## **Currently in alpha; stability cannot be guaranteed.**

## Features
- **Dark mode**
  - Recolored the vanilla UI for a cozy feel.
  - Darkens the loading screen so that it doesn't blind you when you open the game or edit your resourcepacks.
- **Options sync**
  - Syncs your settings from your default Minecraft folder based on your OS.

## Known issues:
- If a resourcepack is not in both your OS determined default Minecraft Directory and the active Minecraft instance directory, your resource packs may get disabled when you switch back to the default path's instance until you turn them back on. This issue is priority for this project atm.
