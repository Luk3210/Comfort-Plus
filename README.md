## **Currently in alpha; stability cannot be guaranteed. Always use the latest version.**

## Features
- **Dark mode**
  - Recolored the vanilla UI for a cozy feel.
  - Darkens the loading screen so that it doesn't blind you when you open the game or edit your resource packs.
- **Invisible offhand totem**
  - Makes a totem in your off-hand invisible when in first person to widen your view.
- **Peace and quiet**
  - Makes zombie piglins and endermen (commonly farmed mobs), minecarts, eating, drinking, water, and nether portals quieter.
- **No Fog**
  - Disables nether and end fog, which are the main annoying ones. This keeps the overworld fog so that chunks load in visually smoothly.
## Coming Soon:
- Multiplayer button from the pause screen
- Global options
- Clear water
- Lower shield
